<h2><b><u><i>BIKE INFO</i></u></b></h2>
<p>There really is something about riding bikes. I love the freedom I feel while riding, it's always worth the effort. Even more than just riding, I love racing . I appreciate the challenge, and the fact that I will push myself harder during a race. The Breck Epic was a true challenge and test for me. In all honesty I was ill for most of the race. I chalk this up to bad luck on my part and am not too upset about the outcome. It could have been worse and I am lucky to be out there giving it my all and just riding my bike. </p>

<p>I started the stage thinking that I would be stronger on the day. As soon as I started up the first steep climb, my stomach turned and all I could do was tell myself to not throw up while spinning as easy as possible. A gentleman behind me sensed my obvious distress. He stayed with me the entire climb talking and encouraging me through. I don't know who he was, but I'm so thankful for him. This was the basic theme of my day. I took one hill/corner/road/trail at a time and eventually finished. </p>
<p>With that final stage I finished the Breck Epic. This was not my best performance, but I'm still proud of my efforts. I am taking home three major lessons from this experience. First, I always have a lot more in my legs than I think I do. Even starting a ride feeling depleted, my legs still got me up the enormous hills. Second, I am more competent on technical ascents and descents than I thought. Instead of getting off the bike and being afraid of some of the obstacles, I rode them with style. I definitely wasn't the fastest, but I didn't wreck and surprised myself daily. I have come so far during this week in terms of skill, I couldn't</p>
